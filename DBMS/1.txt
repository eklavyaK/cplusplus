What are keys?
Keys in relational database management systems helps you to identify a row in a relation. They establish relation between two tables


Candidate key: 
the minimual set off attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple (or row) is known as candidate key. the value of candidate key is unique and not null
for ex: roll number is a candidate key, because it is unique for all the person details


what are prime attributes?
all the candidate keys or attributes come under prime attributes


primary key:
out of all candidate keys, we can select one of them as primary key as required, for ex: one of - aadhaar no, roll no, pan no


alternate key:
if we select one of the candidate keys as primary key, then all the remaining candidate keys are called alternate keys, for ex: if we select roll no as primary key then, aadhaar no and pan no are alternate keys


super key:
the set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple is known as super key, for ex: (roll no, name), (adhaar no, city) all these two sets can be used to find a person uniquely so, these sets are super keys. Adding zero or more keys to a candidate key gives you a super key set. If non candidate keys used on combination to generate a uniqueness then that set of keys will be called a super key


foreign key:
foreign keys are the column of the table which is used to point to the primary key of another table.
Here another table which is used as source is called parent table and current which is using the source to extract information is called child table
