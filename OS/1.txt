Definitions for various Multis:

Multiprogramming (context switching is possible): Multiprogramming is a type of parallel processing that allows multiple programs to run on a single processor system. In a multiprogramming system, the operating system (OS) coordinates the execution of multiple programs in different stages. While one program is waiting for an I/O operation to finish, another program can use the CPU. This allows multiple tasks to share the CPU time.

Multi-Tasking (context switching with fixed interval and also at I/O): Multitasking is an extension of multiprogramming systems. In a multitasking operating system keeps track of each job, allows users to switch between jobs without losing data, utilizes the concept of many processors. There is a certain time interval in which the switching happens, for ex- 1000 ms. Also the switching is done when other process is idle i.e. it goes into I/O.

Multi-processing (multiple processors are involved along with multi-tasking): Multiprocessor operating systems are used in operating systems to boost the performance of multiple CPUs within a single computer system. Multiple CPUs are linked together so that a job can be divided and executed more quickly. When a job is completed, the results from all CPUs are compiled to provide the final output.

Multithreading : In multithreading, multiple threads are created within same process, executing independently but concurrently sharing process resources, i.e. no memory isolation.
