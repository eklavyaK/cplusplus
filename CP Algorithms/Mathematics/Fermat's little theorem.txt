Fermat's Theorem:

    -----if 'a' is a positive integer and 'p' is a prime number. 
    -----'a' is not divisible by 'p'.

    then fermat's theorem says that a^(p-1) mod p = 1 mod p 
    or, basically a^(p-1) mod p = 1;


Applications of the theorem:

    to calculate the modular inverse. like computing nCr.
