	/*Dynamic memory allocation in C/C++ refers to performing memory allocation manually by programmer. 
	Dynamically allocated memory is allocated on Heap and non-static and local variables get memory allocated on Stack

	The new operator denotes a request for memory allocation on the Free Store.
	syntax: int* a = new int; float* b = new float; string *s = new string;
	in the syntax we can see that memory allocation requires the type of data to be stored so that number of bytes will be allocated

	to store a block of memory syntax is:
	int* a = new int[10]; float* b = new float[10]; string * s = new string[10];

	we can also do this for user defined data types: 
	`````````````
	struct cust{int p; cust(int q) : p(q) {}};
	cust* var1 = new cust;
	```````````````
	There is a difference between declaring a normal array and allocating a block of memory using new. 
	The most important difference is, normal arrays are deallocated by compiler (If array is local, then deallocated when function returns or completes).
	 However, dynamically allocated arrays always remain there until either they are deallocated by programmer or program terminates.*/
