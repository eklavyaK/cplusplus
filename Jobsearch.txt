I recently graduated from IIT Roorkee with B.Tech in Electronics and Communications Engineering. During our placement season I was placed in a software company on Day 1. However due to current economic scenario of the company my offer has been rescinded. Being an passionate software developer I can't wait to start working in the industry and I'm actively looking for an internship or a full time role  in software development.

During my academic career, I have consistently worked on challenging projects and and have diverse understanding of concepts in computer science and machine learning. My coursework and projects have equipped me with practical experience in solving complex tasks, developing machine learning models and executed several novel projects. I've strong problem solving abilities which is a result of my passion for competitive programming. I'm fast learner and have strong will to learn new technologies and apply them to solve real world problems.
