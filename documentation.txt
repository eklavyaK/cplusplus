The DFSAR introduces fully polarized (FP) imaging, wherein the radar  transmits two orthogonal polarizations (e.g., horizontal-horizontal, vertical-vertical) and records the received signals for all possible combinations (HH, HV, VH, VV) using a 4x4 scattering matrix. Each polarization combination captures unique scattering properties of the target.

Radar backscatter will also vary depending on the incidence angle
of the radar beam. Previous studies using FP SAR data of
terrestrial settings indicated that surface scattering models could
be developed using the relationship between surface roughness
and dielectric parameters and the intensity, polarization, and
angular dependence of the backscattered wave


The DFSAR instrument is designed to operate in any of
these modes: single (HH/VV), dual (HH+HV/VV
+VH), hybrid (LHCP/RHCP), or Full pol (FP). However, FP is the mode being used for systematic
acquisitions of the lunar polar regions.



How data from the Dual-Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar (DFSAR) instrument is processed and turned into useful products for studying the lunar surface. Here's a simplified explanation:
-> Level-0A/0B:
This is the starting point, where we have raw data from the radar instrument.
-> Level-0A is uncompressed data, while Level-0B is compressed to save space.
These raw data files contain extra information needed for later processing.
-> Level-1A:
In Level-1A, the raw data is turned into images called "single-look complex" (SLC) data.
Each pixel in these images is given a location on the Moon's surface.
-> Level-1B:
Level-1B takes the SLC data and turns it into ground-range images, which are corrected for the curvature of the Moon's surface.
This step helps us get a clearer picture of what's actually on the surface.
-> Level-2:
Finally, Level-2 produces images that are precisely mapped to specific locations on the Moon's surface.
Each pixel is tagged with its exact latitude and longitude coordinates.
-> Additionally, the passage mentions using a special algorithm called Range-Doppler to process the radar data efficiently. This algorithm helps in making sense of the radar images by considering things like the Moon's terrain and the radar's settings.
In simple terms, the DFSAR takes raw data, massages it through various stages of processing, and turns it into images that scientists can use to study the Moon in detail.
After the radar images were obtained, a radiometric calibration process was performed to ensure accurate measurement of radar reflectivity.
The noise-equivalent sigma naught (NESZ) was derived from the noise floor of the system, which represents the lowest radar reflectivity that the instrument can measure reliably.


Purpose of Radiometric Calibration:
Radiometric calibration is a process used to map the pixel values in SAR data to their corresponding backscatter coefficients. These coefficients represent the normalized radar cross-section of targets, which is a measure of their radar reflectivity.
-> Challenges in Lunar Calibration:
Since there are no calibration targets on the Moon with well-known radar cross-section values in the L and S bands, a different approach is needed for calibration.
-> Calibration Equation:
The calibration is performed using the radar equation, which relates the received signal power to various system parameters. The equation includes terms such as:
Digital number (DN): Represents the pixel value after processing.
Factor kv: Accounts for quantization to convert counts to power at the input of the analog-to-digital converter.
Parameters related to system characteristics, such as pulse repetition frequency (PRF), Doppler bandwidth (BW), range sampling frequency, beam-shape loss, and scale factor applied during onboard processing.
-> In essence, radiometric calibration for DFSAR data on the Moon involves using the radar equation and system parameters to convert pixel values to backscatter coefficients. This allows for accurate measurement of radar reflectivity despite the absence of calibration targets on the lunar surface.


Conversion of Digital Counts to Raw Power:
Initially, the processor-gain-related factors are corrected to convert digital counts into raw power, as it would be at the receiver output.
Equation (1) is used to calculate the raw power (Pr) received by the radar, taking into account various parameters such as transmitted power (Pt), antenna gains (Gt and Gr), receiver gain (Grx), slant range (R), radar wavelength (λ), incidence angle (θ), pulse width (τ), manual-gain controller setting (MGCrx), receiver chain front end loss (Ls), and azimuth antenna length (L).
Conversion of Raw Power to Backscatter Coefficients (σ°):
Equation (2) is then used to invert the raw power to derive the radar backscatter coefficient (σ°).
This equation uses lab-measured parameters to relate the received power to the backscatter coefficient, considering factors such as antenna patterns, attenuation, and losses in the radar system.
Radiometric Normalization:
The processed radar images are further corrected using lab-measured antenna patterns for radiometric normalization.
This step ensures that a uniform calibration equation can be applied to the entire dataset, regardless of the pixel position, enabling consistent interpretation of radar imagery.
Calculation of Backscattering Coefficients (σθ) for Level-1A Products:
For Level-1A (SLC) products, the relationship between the digital number (DN) and the backscattering coefficient (σθ) for each polarization channel is established.
Equation (3) describes this relationship, where DN represents the complex pixel value, and calibration constant (K) accounts for calibration differences between different products and datasets.


This passage discusses the derivation of radar backscatter coefficients (σ°) in decibel (dB) scale for Level-1B and above products, as well as the comparison of radiometric accuracy between DFSAR and Mini-RF data. Here's a simplified explanation:
Conversion to dB Scale:
For Level-1B and above products, the radar backscatter coefficients (σ°) can be directly derived in dB scale from the digital number (DN) using Equation (4).
In this equation, the digital number is converted to dB scale using a calibration constant (K).
Comparison of Radiometric Accuracy:
The passage presents specimen results comparing the radiometry of S-band DFSAR hybrid-polarimetric mode data with S-band Mini-RF data over a specific region on the Moon.
Radiometric accuracies, with incidence-angle-independent gamma-naught (γ°), are found to be better than 2 dB over different sample regions.
Validation and Generalization:
Since there is no L-band data or full polarimetry data available for the Moon, validation of the radiometric calibration process is done using S-band hybrid-polarity data from Mini-RF as a reference.
Considering that there are no additional processes that may hinder such a generalization for either L-band or full polarimetry data, a radiometric accuracy of better than 2 dB is considered a worst-case value.



Measured Scattering Matrix:
The "measured" scattering matrix of a target is influenced by both the "actual" scattering properties of the target and distortion introduced by the radar system's transmit and receive paths.
The distortion matrices corresponding to the transmit (T) and receive (R) paths of the radar signal affect the measured scattering matrix.
The measured scattering matrix can be expressed as a product of the actual scattering matrix and distortion matrices, which account for channel imbalances and cross-talk terms.


Polarimetric calibration is a process used in radar imaging to ensure the accuracy of polarization information captured by the radar system. In radar imaging, polarization refers to the orientation of the electromagnetic waves emitted and received by the radar antenna. Polarimetric calibration aims to correct any distortions or inaccuracies in the polarization data to improve the quality and reliability of radar images.


Polarimetric calibration in the context of lunar imaging with the DFSAR (Dual-Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar) system involves a specific methodology that corrects for polarization distortions in the radar data. Here's a breakdown of the process outlined in the passage:
-> Faraday Rotation Exclusion:
Since lunar imaging doesn't involve significant ionospheric effects, Faraday rotation of signals, which occurs due to the Earth's ionosphere, is not expected and is not accounted for in the calibration process.
-> Application after SAR Image Formation and Radiometric Calibration:
Polarimetric calibration is performed after the SAR image formation and radiometric calibration steps.
-> Methodology Inspired by Sun et al. (2018):
The calibration methodology closely follows the approach described by Sun et al. (2018). This method has several advantages:
It doesn't rely on external calibration targets like corner reflectors, which are not available in lunar imaging.
Cross-talk estimation and channel imbalances are iteratively estimated due to their interdependency.
Computations are based on a derived covariance matrix, resulting in more precise equations for estimating phase.
-> Focus on Dominant Backscatter Regions:
The polarimetric calibration process focuses on dominant surface and volume backscatter regions for both co-polarization and cross-polarization signal responses.
-> Phase Calibration Results:
Phase histograms are used to assess the effectiveness of the calibration process.
The results show significant phase corrections required for both L-band and S-band acquisitions, particularly for co-polarization and cross-polarization cases.
The stability of the calibrated phases over multiple acquisitions is monitored, indicating that a uniform set of calibration factors can generally be applied to the DFSAR data sets. However, continuous monitoring and adjustment of calibration coefficients are necessary for future acquisitions to ensure accuracy.
-> In summary, polarimetric calibration in lunar imaging with the DFSAR system involves a tailored methodology to correct for polarization distortions, focusing on dominant backscatter regions and utilizing phase histograms to assess calibration effectiveness. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of calibration coefficients are essential for maintaining accuracy in future acquisitions.


The passage describes the construction of a 2x2 complex scattering matrix [S] in Fully Polarimetric (FP) mode for the DFSAR (Dual-Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar) system. Here's a simplified explanation:
-> Orthogonal Polarizations:
In FP mode, DFSAR transmits two orthogonal polarizations: Horizontal (H) and Vertical (V), and receives scattered waves in the same polarization basis as used for transmission.
-> Scattering Matrix:
The complex scattering matrix [S] relates the two-dimensional transmitted and received electric field vectors [E] for one snapshot of the received echoes.
The matrix [S] is expressed as a 2x2 matrix with elements representing different polarizations:
HH: Horizontal transmit, Horizontal receive
HV: Horizontal transmit, Vertical receive
VH: Vertical transmit, Horizontal receive
VV: Vertical transmit, Vertical receive
All elements of [S] are complex-valued.
-> Attenuation Factor:
The factor exp(-ikr)/r accounts for attenuation due to the spherical wave nature of the radar signal, where k is the wavenumber and r is the distance between the scatterer and the radar.
-> Amplitude and Phase Changes:
The elements of [S] describe the amplitude and phase changes imposed on the incident field by the scattering process.
-> Symmetry of Scattering Matrix:
In monostatic configurations like that of DFSAR, the scattering matrix [S] becomes symmetric, meaning that SHV = SVH for all reciprocal scattering media.
-> Reconstruction of Scattering Amplitude:
Once the full scattering matrix is measured, any arbitrary complex scattering amplitude can be reconstructed linearly from the matrix.
-> In summary, the complex scattering matrix [S] in FP mode of DFSAR relates transmitted and received electric field vectors for different polarizations, allowing for the characterization of scattering properties of targets in radar imagery.


Monostatic Configuration:
In a monostatic configuration, the transmitter and receiver are colocated, meaning they are positioned in the same location or very close to each other.
The radar system emits a signal towards the target, and the same system receives the reflected signal from the target.
In the passage, the DFSAR system is described as operating in a monostatic configuration, where it transmits and receives signals from the same antenna setup.



To fully describe the polarimetric scattering behavior of distributed targets like the lunar surface, a second-order statistical formalism is necessary. This formalism typically involves the use of a 3x3 coherency or covariance matrix, denoted as [T] or [C] respectively. These matrices are derived from the outer product of a three-dimensional scattering vector, usually represented in either Pauli or lexicographic formulation.
After obtaining the coherency or covariance matrices, further processing is often required to assess the scattering mechanism of distributed targets. This typically involves multilook processing, which entails averaging several independent estimates of reflectivity contained within the matrices.
The multilook processing serves several purposes:
-> Speckle Reduction: By averaging over multiple looks, speckle noise in the radar imagery is reduced. Speckle noise is an inherent characteristic of SAR imagery caused by coherent processing of radar returns.
-> Azimuth Resolution Degradation: However, the averaging process also degrades the azimuth resolution of the imagery, typically by a factor proportional to the square root of the number of looks (N^1/2).
-> Since SAR images are formed by coherently processing returns from successive pulses, variations in intensity from pixel to pixel are observed. This variation is manifested as a granular pattern known as speckle. Multilook processing helps to mitigate the effects of speckle while sacrificing some resolution.
In summary, the use of statistical formalisms like the 3x3 coherency or covariance matrix, along with multilook processing, is essential for fully characterizing the polarimetric scattering behavior of distributed targets such as the lunar surface in SAR imagery.
