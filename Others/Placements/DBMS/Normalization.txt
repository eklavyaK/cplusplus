First Normal form (1NF):
It contains atomic values. No multiple values. Two values  in a cell is not allowed
for ex- phone number can take multiple values for a person in that case to make 1NF form we must duplicate the record and keep two different phone numbers in both the rows to make it 1NF form

Second Normal Form (2NF):
It should have all the  properties of the first normal  form (1NF)
Additonal condition that, every non-primary-key attribute is fully functional dependent on the primary key.
In case of partial functional dependency, we have to split the table into more subtables, so that no attribute is fully functional dependent on any proper subset of a primary key.

Third Normal Form (3NF):
It should have the properties of the second normal form (2NF)
there is no transitive dependency for non-prime attributes.
Transitive dependency occurs when a non prime attribute is dependent on another non - prime attribute. In this case we can make another table where non prime attribute on which another non prime attribute depends can be made prime attribute in this table

Boyce Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
It should be 3NF
Every non-trivial functional dependence (x -> y), x should be a super key, i.e. lhs of every functional dependence should be have closure containing all the attributes.
If there is functional dependence that doesn't follow this condition we make a separate table for it
